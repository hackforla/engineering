### Overview

We need to recruit more engineering mentors.

### Background

Mentors are always in demand.  Potential mentors can find an open role card [here](https://github.com/hackforla/engineering/projects/2#card-90139757) which will lead them to the [wiki](https://github.com/hackforla/engineering/wiki/Community-Leads-Open-Roles#engineering-mentor-wanted) which will direct them to fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qYnqZM5JfboFd4Jux-m0puy0ahAlNvmatd09XsxG7YQ/edit) to show their interest.  When someone fills out that form, it will send a notification to engineering@hackforla.com, which will forward to all of the current community leads.  You can also find the results of the form [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k18KYPZxrl8tEbHCo6dgVz4olKvkfVlrlJPxWihKM-4/edit#gid=1483880522).

So that is what the process looks like on the candidate's side.  Here is what you need to do...

Action Items:
- [ ] Check the open roles board and make sure the '[Engineer Mentors](https://github.com/hackforla/engineering/projects/2#card-90139757)' card:
   - is posted under 'Community Lead'
   - the link goes to the correct wiki posting for more details
- [ ] Check the[ leads open roles wiki page ](https://github.com/hackforla/engineering/wiki/Community-Leads-Open-Roles)and make sure the '[Engineering Mentors Wanted](https://github.com/hackforla/engineering/wiki/Community-Leads-Open-Roles#engineering-mentor-wanted)!' section:

   - has correct information
